Deliverables for CV: Sept 2024 - May 2025

Hardware
Gimbal: Keep the Blackfly looking down vertically

Software
Onboard Algorithm: Accept a 720p image and identify standard (+ emergent?) objects

	Algorithm will be programmed on Jetson Nano. 
	
	Traditional CV vs Neural Network (YOLO algorithm or similar)
	
Interfacing: Taking Algorithm output and communicating to Avionics -> Pixhawk 4

27 Weeks total

EOS: OpenCV - Get working model
	Accept 720p image + identify standard (+ emergent?) 
	Return location of object on image. Later, this will be changed to returning "Move" commands to Pixhawk 4.
	
EOY: OpenCV working model on Jetson, working with Pixhawk

Horizontal FOV : 11.7 Degrees
Vertical FOV: 6.9 Degrees

Allows CV to see h15 ft x v9 ft

Different lens? (Probably not.)
