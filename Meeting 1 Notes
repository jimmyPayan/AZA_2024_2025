Deliverables for CV: Sept 2024 - May 2025

Hardware
Gimbal: Keep the Blackfly looking down vertically

Software
Onboard Algorithm: Accept a 720p image and identify standard (+ emergent?) objects

	Algorithm will be programmed on Jetson Nano. 
	
	Traditional CV vs Neural Network (YOLO algorithm or similar)
	
Interfacing: Taking Algorithm output and communicating to Avionics -> Pixhawk 4
